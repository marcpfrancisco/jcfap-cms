              The Junior Confederation of Finance Associations â€“ Philippines
              (JCFAP) was established in 2006 through the collaboration of eight
              schools that were finalists in the FINEX Intercollegiate Finance
              Competition (ICFC).
              <br /> <br />
              Under the guidance of its founding adviser, Mr. Antonilo Mauricio,
              JCFAP has grown into a key national organization, bringing
              together over 160 schools and serving a community of more than
              16,000 finance and ABM (Accountancy, Business, and Management)
              students across the country.
