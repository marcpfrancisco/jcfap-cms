          The Junior Confederation of Finance Associations â€“ Philippines (JCFAP)
          was established in 2006 through the collaboration of eight schools
          that were finalists in the FINEX Intercollegiate Finance Competition
          (ICFC).
          <br /> <br />
          Under the guidance of its founding adviser, Mr. Antonilo Mauricio,
          JCFAP has grown into a key national organization, bringing together
          over 160 schools and serving a community of more than 16,000 finance
          and ABM (Accountancy, Business, and Management) students across the
          country.
